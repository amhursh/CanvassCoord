# Introduction

CanvassCoord is a simple React-Native application built to help make canvassing a breeze.

This is a personal project of [Aaron Hursh](https://github.com/amhursh).  This project consists of a front-end built in React-Native with Redux. The application consumes a RESTful API, which can be found [HERE](https://github.com/amhursh/canvass-coord-api). The backend portion of the application was created with Koa.js using the Knex library to perform SQL queries. This project will continue to see added features and functionality.
